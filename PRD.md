Date: October 5, 2025
Author: Mohammed Zubair A
Status: Final

1. Introduction & Vision
1.1. Overview
The Smart Study Planner is a client-side web application designed to help students overcome the challenges of organizing their study schedules and tracking academic tasks. It provides an intuitive, visually engaging interface for users to create, view, and manage their study goals, complete with reminders and progress tracking. The application will leverage modern web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and use the browser's Local Storage to ensure all user data persists between sessions, requiring no backend or user accounts.

1.2. Problem Statement
Students, especially in high school and university, often struggle with effective time management, leading to procrastination, missed deadlines, and increased stress. They lack a simple, dedicated tool to visualize their workload, prioritize tasks, and track progress over time. Existing tools can be overly complex or lack the specific focus on academic planning.

1.3. Goals & Objectives

Primary Goal: To boost student productivity and improve time management skills.

Key Objectives:

To provide a seamless interface for creating, editing, and deleting academic tasks.

To offer a clear visual representation of schedules and timelines.

To enable users to track their completion progress and stay motivated.

To ensure all data is saved locally, making the app fast, private, and accessible offline.

2. Target Audience & User Persona
2.1. Target Audience

High school students

Undergraduate and graduate university students

Anyone preparing for standardized tests or certifications

2.2. User Persona

3. Features & Functional Requirements
This section details the specific features to be built. Each feature is broken down into user stories.

Epic 1: Core Task Management
User Story 1.1: As a user, I want to create a new task so I can add it to my study plan.

Requirements:

An "Add New Task" button should be prominently displayed.

Clicking this button opens a modal (popup) form.

The form must contain the following fields:

Task Title: (Text input, required, max 100 characters)

Subject/Course: (Text input, optional, e.g., "Data Structures")

Due Date: (Date picker, required)

Priority Level: (Dropdown/Radio buttons: Low, Medium, High)

Description: (Textarea, optional, for more details)

A "Save Task" button in the modal to submit the form.

A "Cancel" or "X" button to close the modal without saving.

Form validation to ensure the "Task Title" and "Due Date" are filled.

User Story 1.2: As a user, I want to view all my pending tasks so I can see what I need to do.

Requirements:

Tasks should be displayed in a list or card-based layout in the main dashboard area.

Each task card must display:

Task Title

Due Date (formatted as "Oct 28, 2025")

Subject/Course

A visual indicator for Priority (e.g., a colored border: Green for Low, Orange for Medium, Red for High).

Tasks should be sorted by Due Date by default (soonest first).

User Story 1.3: As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so I can track my progress.

Requirements:

Each task card must have a checkbox.

When the checkbox is clicked:

The task's visual style should change (e.g., title has a strikethrough, card opacity is reduced).

The task should animate smoothly and move to a separate "Completed Tasks" section or to the bottom of the list.

The progress tracking visualization (see Epic 3) must update instantly.

User Story 1.4: As a user, I want to edit an existing task in case details change.

Requirements:

Each task card must have an "Edit" icon/button.

Clicking "Edit" opens the same modal as creating a task, but pre-filled with the existing task's data.

The user can modify any field and save the changes.

User Story 1.5: As a user, I want to delete a task I no longer need.

Requirements:

Each task card must have a "Delete" icon/button.

Clicking "Delete" should trigger a confirmation prompt (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this task?").

Upon confirmation, the task is permanently removed with a smooth fade-out animation.

Epic 2: Visual Timeline & Schedule View
User Story 2.1: As a user, I want to see my tasks on a timeline so I can visualize my schedule for the week.

Requirements:

A dedicated section/view, perhaps a simple 7-day weekly calendar.

Each day of the week is a column.

Tasks are represented as small cards or chips under their corresponding due date.

Clicking on a task chip in this view could highlight the full task card in the main list or show a tooltip with more details.

Epic 3: Progress Tracking & Motivation
User Story 3.1: As a user, I want to see a summary of my progress to stay motivated.

Requirements:

A dashboard "Progress" widget should be visible at all times.

It should display:

A percentage of completed tasks (e.g., "60% Complete").

A dynamic progress bar or a circular/donut chart that visually represents this percentage.

A text summary, e.g., "You have completed 6 of 10 tasks."

The widget must update in real-time as tasks are marked complete or new tasks are added.

Epic 4: Data Persistence
User Story 4.1: As a user, I want my tasks to be saved so I don't lose my data when I close the browser.

Requirements:

All tasks (including their title, due date, status, etc.) must be saved to the browser's localStorage.

Saving should happen automatically whenever a task is created, edited, completed, or deleted.

When the application is opened, it must first check localStorage for any saved tasks and load them immediately.

4. UI/UX Design & Animations
This section provides a detailed brief for creating an "awesome realistic animated UI".

4.1. General Look & Feel

Theme: Modern, clean, and minimalist with a calming color palette. A "dark mode" would be an excellent touch.

Layout: A responsive three-column layout is recommended for desktop:

Left Sidebar (Navigation): Links to "Dashboard", "Calendar View", "Settings" (future scope). For v1.0, this can be minimal.

Center Column (Main Content): The primary area for displaying the task list.

Right Sidebar (Widgets): To house the "Progress" tracker and maybe a mini-calendar.

Typography: Use a clean, sans-serif font like Poppins or Inter (import from Google Fonts). Use clear font hierarchy (e.g., H1 for titles, smaller font for descriptions).

Color Palette:

Background (Dark Mode): Very dark grey, e.g., #1A1A2E

Card Background: Slightly lighter grey, e.g., #1F2840

Primary Accent Color (for buttons, highlights): A vibrant blue or purple, e.g., #4A6CFD

Priority Colors: High - #FF5C5C, Medium - #FFB800, Low - #00C49F

Text Color: Off-white, e.g., #F0F0F0

4.2. Component Design

Buttons: Should have a subtle box-shadow and a slight "lift" (scale up) animation on hover. The primary "Add New Task" button should be more prominent.

Task Cards:

Rounded corners (border-radius: 12px).

A thin, 3px colored border on the left side to indicate priority.

On hover, the card should subtly elevate with a more pronounced box-shadow.

Modal/Popup:

Should appear with a smooth fade-in and scale-up animation.

The background of the app should be overlaid with a semi-transparent dark layer to focus the user on the modal.

Input Fields & Forms: Modern design with clear labels that float above the input when active.

4.3. Animations & Micro-interactions (Crucial for a "Realistic" Feel)

Task Addition: When a new task is saved, it should not just appear. It should animate into the list, perhaps sliding down from the top.

Task Deletion: When a task is deleted, it should animate out by fading and shrinking in size.

Task Completion: The strikethrough effect should have a smooth drawing animation. The card should gracefully animate to the "Completed" section.

Progress Bar: The bar should animate its fill from its previous value to the new value, not just jump.

Hover Effects: All interactive elements (buttons, links, task cards) must have smooth CSS transitions for hover states (e.g., transition: all 0.3s ease;).

5. Technical Specifications
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+).

Styling:

Use CSS Flexbox and/or Grid for responsive layouts.

Use CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for colors and fonts to make theming (like dark mode) easier.

No CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are required; this is a chance to showcase custom CSS skills.

Data Storage: Use the window.localStorage API. Data should be stored as a JSON string (use JSON.stringify() to save and JSON.parse() to retrieve).

Architecture:

index.html: The main structure of the application.

style.css: All styling, including animations.

script.js: All application logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and interaction with localStorage.

Compatibility: The application must be functional and look good on the latest versions of modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
